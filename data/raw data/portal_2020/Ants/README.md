# Portal Ant Data

Census of the ant community occurred every year (1977-2009) over a two week period during July after the summer monsoons have begun. Data collection ended in 2009.

#### Ant bait data
[Portal_ant_bait](Portal_ant_bait.csv) includes data collected by leaving bait piles for ants to forage. `species` and `abundance` are recorded.

#### Ant colony data
[Portal_ant_colony](Portal_ant_colony.csv) includes data collected by counting the number of colonies and colony entrances (openings) near each permanent rebar stake on a plot. `species`, `colonies` and `openings` are recorded.

#### Data flags
[Portal_ant_dataflags](Portal_ant_dataflags.csv) describes the codes used to flag potentially problematic data. These flags are used in the `flag` column of [Portal_ant_colony](Portal_ant_colony.csv).

#### Species
[Portal_ant_species](Portal_ant_species.csv) contains the ant species list and species codes used in [Portal_ant_bait](Portal_ant_bait.csv) and [Portal_ant_colony](Portal_ant_colony.csv).
