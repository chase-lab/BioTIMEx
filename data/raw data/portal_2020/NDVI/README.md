# Portal Plant Monitoring Metadata

[**Long-term monitoring and experimental manipulation of a Chihuahuan Desert plant community near Portal, Arizona (1981 - 2013).**](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1890/15-2115.1/full)

### Abstract

The data set includes ongoing remotely sensed NDVI values of an arid ecosystem in near Portal, Arizona.

### Site description: 

Within the 20 ha study area there are 24 experimental plots. Each plot has an area of 0.25 ha and is fenced to regulate rodent access to the plot. Rodent treatments include controls, kangaroo rat removal, and rodent removal. The ant community, which is also predominately granivorous, is also manipulated. Ant treatments include controls and ant removals. 
On each plot there are 16 permanent plant stations marked by rebar stakes forming a 4x4 grid. 

#### Description of NDVI data:

The NDVI file (monthly_NDVI.csv) is composed of monthly values of NDVI for the area around the Portal Project site, centered on the coordinates 31.937769, -109.08029. It was obtained from the GIMMS NDVI3g dataset, which is a compilation of AVHRR weather sattelite data (Pinzon & Tucker 2014). The original data has a spatial resolution of 8km and a twice monthly temporal resolution, with availability from 1981-2013. We have averaged this to monthly NDVI values.
